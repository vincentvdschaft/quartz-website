title: Time-of-flight correction
---
Time-of-flight (TOF) correction is the process of shifting incoming signals in such a way that all reflections from a specific location arrive at the same time. As such it can be seen as focusing in receive.

How to compute the time-of-flight depends on the [[transmit wavefront shape]].
